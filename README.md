# PPPLCalibrationFramework
A tool to scan through multiple hardware axis and take measurements for the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab

This was developed during an internship for the [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory](http://www.pppl.gov/) (PPPL), sponsored by the DoE and run by Princeton University.

If you have ever needed to painstackenly scan through multiple dimensions are record measurements at each point, then this is for you!

Quickly scan through multiple points along many different axis (X, Y, power, frequency, etc) and measure the value(s) of a sensor at each one.

**Features:**
 - Quickly create and configure axis to scan through
 - Jog axis manually
 - Specify a list of points to scan
 - Import a CSV of pre generated points
 - Export measured data to CSV
 
 **Supported Axis:**
 - [Thorlabs LTS150](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=3961&pn=LTS150#8110) Linear Stage
